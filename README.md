#### Updating the Mirror repository 

To update the repository inside of the InfoViz organization, run. 

```
git push --mirror https://github.com/InfoVizW2018/project-team--ocean-views.git
``` 

Insure you are on master and caught up with a 'working' version of the repository. `--mirror` does a `-f` push, essentially.
